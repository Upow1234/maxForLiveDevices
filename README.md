A collection of my Max for Live Devices

Recorder:

A simple utility recorder for recording from your master track in Live. Drop on an audio track and the device automatically configures input and output routings. Set time you want to record for then press "Record" to begin, if you see output in the mixer you are recording. If you check the waveform display you will see it filling up as well. Write the file with the "Write" button in either .aiff or .wav format, and clear the recorder to start again.

Requires Ableton Live and Max for Live.

Droniator:

This device sustains your current notes after the threshold you've established. Upon playing new notes the old notes are dropped. Toggle "Hold" once notes are sustaining to play over held notes, toggle "Stop" to drop currently sustained notes and prevent new notes from being sustained. Also has a status (waiting/holding) indicator.

Requires Ableton Live and Max for Live.

Filter Midi Note By Octave:

Filters selected MIDI note at every octave. Example, if you select "F" you will only be able to play the "F" note in every octave. 

Requires Ableton Live and Max for Live.
